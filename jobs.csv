**What Is The Role**
 Elastic is building the next generation conversational interface that lets users chat with their own data.

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Build and refine backend endpoints (Node/TypeScript) that power chat, citations, and evaluation loops.
* Help designing, building, and polishing front\\-end features in Kibana using React, TypeScript, and the Elastic UI (EUI) design system: chat transcript panes, prompt composers, citation views, and telemetry opt\\-ins.
* Pair with designers to break product ideas into incremental, testable UI stories and demo them in sprint reviews.
* Instrument the UI for observability \\- usage analytics, error tracking, Web Vitals \\- and use the data to iterate.
* Collaborate with data scientists and other specialists as we experiment with prompt strategies, streaming tokens, and evaluation overlays in the chat experience.

**What You Bring**
* We appreciate articulate and “low ego” people who want to grow as part of a team.
* You understand distributed systems fundamentals, shard routing, and eventual consistency, and can explain them clearly.
* 3\\+ years building production TypeScript services or full\\-stack apps.
* You care about UI quality, accessibility and performance but also enjoy writing integration tests for a REST route or tuning an Elasticsearch query.
* Excitement about LLMs and agentic UX; bonus points for hacking with LangChain/LangGraph, OpenAI function calls, or similar libraries.
* Clear, concise written communication \\- you can turn architecture thoughts into ADRs, PR descriptions, and Slack guidance.
* Nice\\-to\\-have: exposure to Kibana, Elasticsearch, or other large single\\-page apps.
