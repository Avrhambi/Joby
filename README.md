# üß† Joby ‚Äì Personalized Job Notification Platform

## üåç Overview

Joby is a full-stack job notification platform that allows users to create, manage, and receive personalized job alerts based on their preferences.
It consists of three coordinated components:

Frontend (React) ‚Äì The user-facing interface for registration, login, and notification management.

Backend (FastAPI) ‚Äì The main API that handles authentication, user data, and automated email notifications.

Jobs Engine (FastAPI) ‚Äì A microservice that scrapes and aggregates job listings from Indeed and LinkedIn.

The platform enables users to:

Register and log in securely using JWT-based authentication.

Define job search rules (e.g., job title, location, frequency).

Automatically receive job listings by email daily, weekly, or monthly.

View and update personal information and notification preferences via an intuitive React interface.


Main Ports:

Frontend: 3000

Backend: 8001

Jobs Engine: 8002

# üñ•Ô∏è Joby Frontend

A React-based web application that serves as the user interface for the Joby platform.
It enables users to sign up, log in, manage their profiles, and create job notification rules.

üß≠ Routing: Implemented using React Router for seamless navigation.

‚úÖ Validation: Client-side form validation with backend error handling.

üé® Styling: Tailwind-style utility classes for consistent UI design.

üåê Configurable API URL: Uses environment variable REACT_APP_API_URL for backend connection.

üé® Styling and Design

The app uses Tailwind-like utility classes (without a full Tailwind dependency).
Colors and layout styles are defined inline or within reusable components.
For a consistent global theme, you can extract class names into a shared theme file.


üß™ Testing the Frontend

You can test the frontend locally after running the backend:

### Run backend on port 8001
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```
### Run frontend on port 3000
```bash
npm start
```

Once both are running, open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser.
